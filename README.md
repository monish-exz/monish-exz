Hi, I’m Monish 👋

I’m a student and AI/ML learner who enjoys building tools and systems to understand problems properly, not just study them.

I build projects to:
- check how much I really know
- improve my Python and ML fundamentals
- turn ideas into something useful
- develop skills that matter long-term, including entrepreneurship

I’m not chasing trends or hype.
I care about clarity, usefulness, and learning by doing.

## 🔧 What I Build

I mainly work with **Python**, exploring:
- machine learning
- automation
- small, practical tools

Most of my projects start with a simple question:

> *Would this be useful and worth building well?*

Before starting, I usually:
- validate the idea
- look at existing solutions
- decide whether it should be open-source or more experimental

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🧪 ML-Dataset-Lint
A lightweight, rule-based tool to catch dataset issues
before training machine learning models.

It checks for:
- missing values, duplicates, and constant columns
- class imbalance and rare labels
- potential data leakage signals
- basic bias and trainability risks

The goal is to keep it simple, explainable,
and useful for learners and early ML projects.

**Tech:** Python · Machine Learning · Data Quality

### 📰 AI Daily Tech News Automation
An automated system that collects daily AI/ML news
and stores it in Excel and Google Sheets.

Features include:
- RSS-based scraping from trusted sources
- structured storage for offline and cloud access
- logging and basic error handling
- scheduled automation

**Tech:** Python · Automation · Data Pipelines

## 📚 Currently Focusing On

- strengthening Python fundamentals
- understanding ML datasets and data quality issues
- learning through small, focused projects
- improving how I think about systems, not just code

---

## 🎯 Mindset

I believe good tools come from:
- understanding problems clearly
- keeping things simple
- making thoughtful trade-offs

I’m still learning, but I take building seriously.
